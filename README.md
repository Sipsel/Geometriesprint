## Description

Geometriesprint(German for geometry dash) is an automatic 2D-Sidescroller Jump'n'Run that was inspired by the original game made by Robert Topala. Geometriesprint is a open source game that was developed to have more personalisation options than the original. Additionaly it should 
serve as a sandbox for other developers to tinker with.



## Current Version

The Current Version: 1.0 was created on 29.11.2021



## Installation 

To play the game you can open the Github pages link for the repository and play immediately.
Otherwise you can also download the repository to you local machine, unzip the downloaded file and simply open the index.html. 
For the second option we would recommend using the Live-server extension for visual studio code or to host the downloaded files on an apache server for maximum compatability as simply opening the index.html file might led to complications with the file system (more on that in the Bugs Section)
